Most Read from Bloomberg Wall Street Titans Warn of the Next Big Risks for Investors The Unstoppable Appeal of Highway Expansion The Country That Makes Breakfast for the World Is Plagued by Fire, Frost and Drought HSBC Bets Big on China as Pressure Mounts in London An Unapologetic Old Boys’ Network Is Costing Australia Billions Gary Wipfler stepped down in recent weeks, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn’t been announced. He oversaw the iPhone maker’s cash balance, investments and capital-return programs, and he was once a fixture of Apple’s quarterly earnings calls. The 62-year-old executive reported to Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri until his retirement. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Wipfler’s retirement caps a career that spanned several CEOs -- even predating Steve Jobs’s return to the company in 1997, when Apple was famously on the brink of bankruptcy. Wipfler also helped oversee Braeburn Capital, Apple’s Reno, Nevada-based subsidiary that manages its assets. Wipfler also was involved with the company’s racial-justice and affordable-housing efforts. Apple changed its cash strategy when Tim Cook took over as chief executive officer in 2011. He devoted more of the company’s money to share buybacks and dividend programs, while steering clear of big-ticket acquisitions. Its largest deal to date is still the $3 billion takeover of Beats Electronics and Beats Music in 2014. The Cupertino, California-based company ended last quarter with $194 billion in cash and marketable securities. But Apple has been working to reduce its balance as the iPhone maker tries to reach net cash neutral status, meaning the company will have an equal amount of cash and debt.

              "' (Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood sold a near $270 million stake in Tesla Inc. as the bond selloff hit rate-sensitive technology stocks to spur outflows from her growth-focused funds. Most Read from Bloomberg The Country That Makes Breakfast for the World Is Plagued by Fire, Frost and Drought The Unstoppable Appeal of Highway Expansion HSBC Bets Big on China as Pressure Mounts in London How Los Angeles Became the City of Dingbats Why the Gaza Strip May Be the City of the Future Wood’s Ark Investment Management offloaded more than 340,000 Tesla shares across three exchange-traded funds on Tuesday, according to the firm’s daily trading update. Some 11% of the famous ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) is still betting on Elon Musk’s company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm tends to trim the stake when it rises above 10%. Tesla has generally outperformed in the global rout hitting rate-sensitive investing styles, while ARKK posted one of its worst sessions in months on Tuesday. Meanwhile data overnight showed money managers withdrew $297 million from the growth-focused fund on Monday, the most since March, to bring the four-day outflow to more than $660 million. Since the Federal Reserve signaled last week a move to taper pandemic stimulus, Treasury yields have jumped and sent a shockwave through growth shares. Ark funds are heavily exposed to such names thanks to Wood’s focus on disruptive innovation and tech. Tesla remains Wood’s largest bet as the biggest holding for the flagship ARKK fund as well as the firm overall. She predicts its shares will rise from around $778 currently to $3,000. However, Ark often trims its stake in the carmaker when it has performed very well or grown too large in the portfolio. The carmaker was up 5.7% this month through Tuesday, compared with a 5.2% drop for the Nasdaq 100 tech gauge. ARKK was down 8.2%. Trading arrangements for the Ark ETFs mean flow data arrives with a one-day lag, but given ARKK’s 4.2% slump on Tuesday it’s likely there were more outflows in the latest session.
